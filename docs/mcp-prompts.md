5. Document findings and decisions

## Troubleshooting Prompts

### Common Issues

**Prompt doesn't provide expected guidance:**
- Verify prompt name and parameters
- Check project context (single vs multi-project)
- Ensure project is properly scanned

**Tools mentioned in prompt not available:**
- Verify CodeRAG MCP server is connected
- Check tool permissions and configuration
- Restart AI assistant if needed

**Results don't match prompt expectations:**
- Verify project was scanned successfully
- Check for scanning errors or warnings
- Consider re-scanning with different options

### Getting Help

**When prompts aren't helpful:**
1. Check the [Available Tools](available-tools.md) guide
2. Review [Scanner Usage](scanner-usage.md) for setup issues
3. Consult [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for common problems
4. Try a different prompt that might be more appropriate

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Selection
- Start with setup prompts for new projects
- Use specific prompts for focused analysis
- Combine prompts for comprehensive understanding

### 2. Parameter Usage
- Provide specific class names when possible
- Include language context for better guidance
- Use project_id in multi-project environments
- **Pass the current local Git branch** via the optional `branch` parameter on every
  project-scoped tool call (see below)

### Branch-Aware Querying (AI guidance)

CodeRAG can hold multiple branches of the same codebase (see
[Branch Support](multi-project-management.md#branch-support)). To get the most relevant
context, the AI should determine the **current local branch** and pass it as the
`branch` argument:

1. Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` in the workspace to get the active branch.
2. Pass that value as `branch` to tools like `search_nodes`, `semantic_search`,
   `find_implementations`, etc.
3. If the branch is a feature branch that is not indexed, the server automatically falls
   back to an integration branch (e.g. `develop` → `main`) and prepends a `⚠️` notice
   stating which branch actually served the data. Treat that context as the **base**,
   and read the local feature diff directly from the working-tree files.

To make this automatic for an analyzed repository, drop an agent-instruction file into
that repo. A ready-to-use template ships with CodeRAG at
[`docs/examples/AGENTS.branch-aware.md`](examples/AGENTS.branch-aware.md) — copy it to
the analyzed project as `AGENTS.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.


### 3. Result Interpretation
- Follow prompt guidance for interpreting results
- Look for patterns and trends, not just individual metrics
- Consider architectural context when evaluating findings

### 4. Documentation
- Document key findings from prompt-guided analysis
- Share insights with team members
- Use results to plan improvements and refactoring
