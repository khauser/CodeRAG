# CodeRAG - Enterprise Code Intelligence Platform

**Advanced graph-based code analysis for AI-assisted software development**

CodeRAG is a professional code intelligence platform that transforms complex software projects into searchable knowledge graphs. By mapping code structures, dependencies, and relationships, it enables AI development tools to provide contextually accurate assistance for enterprise-scale codebases.

## What CodeRAG Does

CodeRAG creates a comprehensive graph database representation of your codebase using Neo4J, enabling sophisticated analysis and AI-powered insights:

- **Automated Code Analysis** - Scans and maps classes, methods, interfaces, dependencies, and architectural relationships across multiple programming languages
- **Remote Repository Analysis** - Directly analyze any GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository without local cloning, supporting both public and private repositories with secure authentication
- **Intelligent Language Detection** - Automatically identifies project languages, frameworks, and build configurations from metadata and build files  
- **Quality Assessment** - Calculates industry-standard software metrics (CK metrics, package coupling, architectural patterns) to identify technical debt and improvement opportunities
- **Semantic Code Search** - Enables natural language queries to find code by functionality rather than syntax
- **Multi-Project Management** - Supports enterprise environments with multiple codebases, providing unified analysis and cross-project insights

## Who Should Use CodeRAG

### Enterprise Development Teams
- **Large-scale projects** with complex architectures requiring deep code understanding
- **Legacy system maintenance** where comprehensive codebase mapping is essential
- **Code quality initiatives** needing objective metrics and architectural analysis

### AI-Assisted Development
- **Development teams using AI coding assistants** (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) who need enhanced contextual awareness
- **Code review processes** requiring comprehensive understanding of change impacts
- **Architectural decision-making** supported by data-driven insights

### Software Engineering Leadership

- **Package Metrics** - Afferent/Efferent Coupling, Instability, Abstractness
- **Architectural Analysis** - Circular dependency detection, design pattern identification

### Advanced Search Capabilities  
- **Semantic Search** - Natural language queries powered by AI embeddings
- **Relationship Mapping** - Trace dependencies, inheritance hierarchies, and method calls
- **Pattern Detection** - Identify design patterns and architectural structures
